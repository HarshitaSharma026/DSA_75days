## Algorithms Used 

### Dutch National Flag Algorithm
- To sort an array having 0, 1, and 2s.

### QuickSelect algorithm
- To find kth smallest and largest element in an array
- average time complexity: O(n)
- worst time complexity: O(n^2), when the array is arranged in sorted order.

### Greedy Algorithm
- in questions like "Minimum number of jumps to make", where we need the come up with best possible thing to do at that stage / moment

### Fast and slow pointer
- Floyd's hare and tortoise algo for cycle detection
- where slow pointer moves one step ahead, and fast pointer move two steps ahead.
